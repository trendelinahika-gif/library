# Library Web App - Fixes Applied

## Issue
The web application was loading but showing a blank page after both frontend and backend servers were running.

## Root Cause
The `src/components/Header.tsx` file had critical errors:

1. **Missing React Hook Imports**
   - `useEffect`, `useRouter`, `usePathname` were used but not imported
   
2. **Missing Framer Motion Imports**
   - `motion` and `AnimatePresence` components were used but not imported
   
3. **Missing Icon Imports**
   - Multiple Lucide React icons were used but not imported: `User`, `Calendar`, `Bell`, `Heart`, `Settings`, `Search`, `ChevronDown`, `LogOut`

4. **Duplicate Code**
   - `menuItems` array was declared twice at the top of the file
   - `isMenuOpen` state was declared twice

## Solution Applied

### Fixed `src/components/Header.tsx`
- ✅ Added all missing imports from `react`, `next/navigation`, `lucide-react`, and `framer-motion`
- ✅ Removed duplicate code declarations
- ✅ Fixed navigation to use Next.js `Link` components properly
- ✅ Ensured proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Added proper ARIA labels for accessibility

### Also Fixed `backend/server.js`
- ✅ Removed deprecated MongoDB connection options (`useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`)
- ✅ Added graceful fallback for MongoDB connection failures
- ✅ Added timeout for MongoDB connection (5 seconds)

## Current Status

✅ **Backend Server**: Running on http://localhost:5000
✅ **Frontend Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ **Application**: Should now load correctly without blank page

## How to Use

1. **Access the Application**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000/api/health

## Server Management

Both servers are running in separate PowerShell windows:
- To stop: Close the PowerShell windows or press `Ctrl+C` in each
- To restart: Run `npm run dev` for frontend and `npm run dev` in backend folder
