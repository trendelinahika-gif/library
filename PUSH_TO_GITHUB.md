## 📝 Since GitHub is Linked with Cursor:

### Option 1: Use Cursor's GitHub Integration (Easiest)

1. **In Cursor:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + G` (open Source Control)
   - Or click the Source Control icon in the left sidebar
   
2. **Publish to GitHub:**
   - You should see a "Publish to GitHub" button
   - Click it
   - Choose repository name: `library-kosovo`
   - Choose public or private
   - Click "Publish"
   
**Done!** Cursor will create the repo and push everything automatically!

### Option 2: Command Line (If Option 1 doesn't work)

```powershell
# 1. Create repository on GitHub first
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Name: library-kosovo
# Don't add README

# 2. Get your GitHub username
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME below

# 3. Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/library-kosovo.git
git push -u origin main
```

**When prompted for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Since you're linked with Cursor, it should authenticate automatically
- OR use a Personal Access Token

### Option 3: GitHub CLI (Alternative)

```powershell
# Login (should use Cursor's auth)
gh auth login

# Create repo and push
gh repo create library-kosovo --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```
