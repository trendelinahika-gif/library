## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Mongoose Duplicate Index Warnings (FIXED)
**Problem:**
```
Warning: Duplicate schema index on {"email":1} found
Warning: Duplicate schema index on {"username":1} found  
Warning: Duplicate schema index on {"isbn":1} found
Warning: Duplicate schema index on {"slug":1} found
```

**Solution:**
- Removed redundant index declarations from `backend/models/User.js`
- Removed redundant index declarations from `backend/models/Book.js`
- Removed redundant index declarations from `backend/models/News.js`
- Fields with `unique: true` already create indexes automatically

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/models/User.js` - Removed email and username index duplicates
- `backend/models/Book.js` - Removed isbn index duplicate
- `backend/models/News.js` - Removed slug index duplicate

### 2. ✅ Frontend Blank Page Issue (FIXED)
**Problem:**
- Page was loading but showing blank/white screen
- Components were not rendering properly

**Solution:**
- Simplified `src/app/page.tsx` with proper loading states
- Rewrote `src/components/Hero.tsx` without complex animations that might cause hydration issues
- Removed dependency on Framer Motion for critical render path
- Added proper loading spinner with clear feedback
- Fixed all missing imports and dependencies

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Simplified with better error handling
- `src/components/Hero.tsx` - Rewritten with clean, working code
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Previously fixed all imports
